Hello There

My name is Felix Barosio and I am currently a student Softwaare Developer based in Nairobi, Kenya.

My current project is a simple page for a real estate webpage. I used css and html to build it.

My project is basically platform where a user or a perspective buyer of a piece of land or a house can find all the iformation they might need. The page provides them with information of what is of interest to them.

Program setup is quite simple but currently I am hosting it at Github Pages. This is a link to access it: https://felix-barosio.github.io/Project/
